# Hey there! I'm Oscar, all about exploring the realms of science and diving into the world of coding. ðŸš€

## **Disclaimer:** I currently work in a GIT environment hosted on my company's private server using Gitea. This means that, although I'm actively involved in development and collaboration on projects, most of my work won't be visible here on GitHub.
